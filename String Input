Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print() and input(). 
Write a program to get the string as input and print it. The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard.  

Sample Input :
Programmer

Sample Output :
Programmer

NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Program:
a=(input())
print(a)
