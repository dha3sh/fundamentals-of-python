(count the number of lowercase letters and uppercase letters in a string.) Problem Description The program takes a string and counts the number of lowercase letters 
and uppercase letters in the string. 

Problem Solution 
1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 
2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 
3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a lowercase character is encountered 
   and increment the second count variable each time a uppercase character is encountered. 
4. Print the total count of both the variables. 
5. Exit.

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of one string.
Output consists of two integers.
First output consists of count of the uppercase.
Second output consists of count of the lowercase.

Program:
s = str(input())
upper=0
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i].isupper():
        upper+=1
lower=len(s)-upper
print(upper)
print(lower)
