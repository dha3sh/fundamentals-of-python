Write a program to find the mean of the elements in the array. 

Input Format: 
Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array. 
The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array. 
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. 

Output Format: 
Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the mean of the array.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications. [All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]

Sample Input and Output : 
5
2
4
1
3
1

Sample Output:
2.2

Program:
n=int(input())
a=[]
for i in range(0,n):
    m=int(input())
    a.append(m)
print(sum(a)/n)
