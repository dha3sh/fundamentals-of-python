 Program to find if the given numbers are Friendly pair or not (Amicable or not) is discussed here. Friendly Pair are two or more numbers with a common abundance.

Input & Output format: 
Input consists of 2 integers.
The first integer corresponds to number 1 and the second integer corresponds to number 2.
If it is a Friendly Pair display Friendly Pair or displays Not Friendly Pair.
For example,6 and 28 are Friendly Pair.

(Sum of divisors of 6)/6 = (Sum of divisors of 28)/28.

Sample Input:
6
28

Sample Output:
Friendly Pair

Program:
n1 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())
sum1 = 0
sum2 = 0
for i in range(1,n1+1):
	if(n1 % i == 0):
		sum1 = sum1 + i
for i in range(1,n2+1):
	if(n2 % i == 0):
		sum2 = sum2 + i
if(sum1 == n1 and sum2 == n2):
	print("Friendly Pair")
else:
	print("Not Friendly Pair")
