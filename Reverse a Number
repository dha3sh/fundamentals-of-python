Write program to reverse a number is discussed here. We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of a integer.
Output consists of reversed input.

Sample Input: 
13579

Sample Output: 
97531

Program:
n=int(input())
rev=0
temp=n
while n!=0:
    rem=n%10
    rev=rev*10+rem
    n=n//10
print(rev)
