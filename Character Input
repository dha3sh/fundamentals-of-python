Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. 
Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input().. Write a program to get a character as input and print it. 
The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in variable test Character. 

NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Sample Input:
z

Sample Output:
z

Program:
a=(input())
print(a)
