A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. 
Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. 
The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

Input Format:
The first input is an integer which corresponds to the number of items. The second integer is a float which corresponds to the single item heating time.

Output Format:
Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.

Note:All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output

Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50

Sample Input and Output 2:
Enter the number of items
4
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
Number of items is more

Program:-
print("Enter the number of items")
n=int(input())
print("Enter the single item heating time")
s=float(input())
if(n>3):
    print("Number of items is more")
elif(n==2):
    a=((0.5*s)+s)
    print("The recommended heating time is "'%.2f'%a)
elif(n==3):
    a=(2*s)+s
    print("The recommended heating time is "'%.2f'%a)
