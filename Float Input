Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. 
Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input(). Write a program to get float as input and print it. 
The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a float, it is stored in variable test Float.
Use '%.2f' in the print() to display float value with 2 precisions. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Sample Input :
56.2425

Sample Output :
56.24

Program:
a=float(input())
print('%.2f'%a)
