Write a Python Program to calculate the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Description The program takes a string and
calculates the number of digits and letters in a string.
Problem Solution 
1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 
2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 
3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a digit is encountered and increment the second count
   variable each time a character is encountered.
4. Print the total count of both the variables. 5. Exit.

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of a string
Output consists of two integers.
First output refers to the total count of the characters.
Second output refers to the total count of the digits.

Sample Input & Output:
Cyfuno2020
Characters = 6
Digits = 4

Program:
n=input()
dig=0
for i in range(len(n)):
    if n[i].isdigit():
        dig+=1
cts=len(n)-dig
print("Characters=",cts)
print("Digits=",dig)
