Write a program to find the sum of numbers in a given range is discussed here. Given the starting and ending interval,
the sum of all the numbers in that range will be displayed as output.

For example,

Input: 1 10

Output: 55

Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of two integers.
First input consists of the start value.
Second input consists of the end value.
Output consists of the sum of range.

Sample Input 1:
1
10

Sample Output 1:
55

Program:
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
sum=0
if a<b:
    for i in range(a,b+1):
        sum=sum+i
    print(sum)
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
