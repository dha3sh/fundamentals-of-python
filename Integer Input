Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input().
Write a program to get an integer as input and print it. The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters an integer,
it is stored in variable test Integer. 

NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Sample Input:
56

Sample Output:
56

Program:
a=int(input())
print(a)
