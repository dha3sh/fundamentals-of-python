Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, 
rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes. 

Input format: 
First input: a side of a square in integer 
Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 

Output format: 
The first output should be the area of a square in integer 
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 
The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Sample Input: 
5

12.56

Program:
a=int(input())
l=int(input())
b=int(input())
r=float(input())
w=a*a
x=l*b
y=float(3.14*r*r)
print(w)
print(x)
print('%.2f'%y)
