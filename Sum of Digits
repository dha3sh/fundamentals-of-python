For example, let the input number be 719. The sum of digits of 719 = 7 + 1 + 9 = 17

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of one integer.
Output consists of sum of digits.

Sample Input:
719

Sample Output:
17

Program:
n=int(input())
sum=0
while n!=0:
    rem=n%10
    sum=sum+rem
    n=n//10
print(sum)
